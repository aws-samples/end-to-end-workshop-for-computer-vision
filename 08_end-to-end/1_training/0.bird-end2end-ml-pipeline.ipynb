    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we will walk you through a step by step process to prepare, build and train computer vision models with Amazon SageMaker and deploy them to AWS panorama for edge inference. The workshop image classification of different species of birds, but the concept can be applied to a wide range of industrial applications. We will complete the CV MLOps lifecycle covering: data labeling, continuous integrated (CI/CD) training pipeline, model updates to the edge w/ approval, and, fianlly, edge inferencing and data capture back to the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "---\n",
    "![MLOps Pattern](statics/end2end.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture we will build during this workshop is illustrated on the right. Several key components can be highlighted:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data labeling w/ SageMaker GroundTruth**: We are using the CUB_MINI.tar data which is a subset of [Caltech Birds (CUB 200 2011)](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200-2011.html) dataset. The code below will spin up a GoundTruth labeling job for private/public workforce to label.  The output is a fully labeled manifest file that can be ingested by the atutomated training pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Automated training Pipeline** Once the dataset is fully labelled, we have prepared a SageMaker pipeline that will go through steps: preprocessing, model training, model evaluation, and storing the model to model registry.  At the same time, the example code will provide advance topics like streaming data with pipe mode and fast file mode, monitor training with SageMaker debugger, and distributed training to increase training effeciency and reduce training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Deployment & Edge Inferencing w/ AWS Panorama** With manual approval of the model in Model registry, we can kick off the edge deploymnet with a deployment lambda.  That can be accomplish using the AWS Panorama API.  We will also illustration the edge application development and testing using the AWSW Panorama Test Utility (Emulator)"

    "- <span style=\"color:red\">The notebook use public workforce (Mechanical Turk) for the groundTruth labeling job. That will incur some cost at **$0.012 per image**.  If want to use a prviate workforce, then you must have a private workforce already created and update the code with your private workforce ARN. Please follow this [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-workforce-create-private-console.html) on how to create a private workforce</span>\n",

AWS Panorama gives you the ability to make real-time decisions to improve your operations, by giving you compute power at the edge.\n",

    "To try out the full Panorama experience, you need a Camera that support RTSP stream and Panorama appliance to deployment your model and application setup on the same local network. **Knowing that not everyone will have access to the equipment, we will talk about the setup and deployment experience, and practice developing Panorama application in the Panorama test utility.**"
